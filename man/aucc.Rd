\usage{
aucc(
  partition,
  dataset = NULL,
  distance = NULL,
  distanceMethod = "euclidean",
  returnRates = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{partition}{A hard/crisp partition (array of integers specifying cluster memberships).}

\item{dataset}{The dataset from which the partition was obtained.}

\item{distance}{The distances between object pairs. This should be obtained with the dist function (please, see ?dist).}

\item{distanceMethod}{The distance method that should be employed to compute distances from the dataset (please, check ?dist for more information on options). This parameter is used only if distance is not provided, given that they should be computed internally by the aucc function from the dataset.}

\item{returnRates}{If TRUE, TPR and FPR are returned alongside AUCC in an object of class "aucc" (useful for plot purposes). Default is FALSE, in which case the function directly outputs a numeric value that corresponds to the AUCC of the partition.}
}
\value{
If returnRates=FALSE (default), the function returns a numerical value, which corresponds to the AUCC of the partition (clustering solution). If returnRates=TRUE, the function returns an object of class "aucc", with the following components/fields:
\itemize{
\item aucc: the AUCC value of the partition.
\item tpr: the corresponding True Positive Rate (TPR) values.
\item fpr: the corresponding False Positive Rate (FPR) values.
}
}
\description{
Computes the Area Under the (ROC) Curve for Clustering (AUCC).
}
\details{
Function computes the Area Under the (ROC) Curve for Clustering (AUCC) of a partition.

You need to provide a partitioning of the data (clustering solution) and one of the following:

(i)   the dataset from which the partition was originated;

(ii)  the distance matrix for the data from which the partition was originated.

In case of (i), you may also specify the distance function that will be employed to compute the distances internally by aucc, using the distanceMethod parameter. If you do not specify any string, it defaults to the Euclidean Distance. Make sure to pass strings accepted by the dist function (package stats), see ?dist.

In case of (ii), make sure that the distance matrix was originated/converted with the function
dist from the package stats, using the parameters diag = FALSE, upper = FALSE (these are the
defaults for dist). Other than that, you may choose any distance / dissimilarity you find
appropriate for your data. If you have to perform multiple computations of aucc for the same
dataset, with different partitions, prefer this approach as computing the distance matrix
repeatedly can be computationally expensive.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Make sure to validate your partition(s) with the same distance you used to generate it.
}

\examples{
# Example 1 (basic usage, returnRates=FALSE)

# Computing AUCC from the dataset itself, partition with k = 2
clustering <- kmeans(ruspini,2)$cluster
print(aucc(clustering, dataset = ruspini))

# Computing AUCC from a precomputed distance matrix and selecting best k
ruspiniDistances <- dist(ruspini)

auccValues <- c()

#varying k in a reasonable range...
maxK <- ceiling(sqrt(dim(ruspini)[1]))

for (k in 2:maxK) {
   clustering <- kmeans(ruspini,k)$cluster
   auccValues <- append(auccValues, aucc(clustering, distance = ruspiniDistances))
}

# Printing the suggested number of clusters and plotting the results
sprintf('Suggested number of clusters is: \%d', which.max(auccValues)+1)
plot(2:maxK,auccValues)

# Example 2 (getting full report, returnRates=TRUE)

clustering <- kmeans(ruspini,2)$cluster
evaluation <- aucc(clustering, dataset = ruspini, returnRates=TRUE)

print(evaluation$aucc)

#calling package function to plot the corresponding ROC Curve
rocPlot(evaluation)
